# JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Solutions
Welcome! This repository contains my solutions and notes for learning and practicing core computer science concepts — especially algorithms and data structures — using JavaScript.
## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in problem solving, algorithm design, and data structure implementation through structured challenges and exercises.

## 🛠️ What's Included
- Problem-solving patterns (e.g., frequency counter, multiple pointers, sliding window)
- Recursion techniques (helper method recursion, pure recursion)
- Classic algorithms (binary search, quick sort, merge sort, etc.)
- Data structures (singly linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Time and space complexity analysis with Big O notation
- Clean, testable, and well-commented JavaScript solutions

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariscalromeroalejandro/data-structures-js
```

## 🧭 Progress

This repo is a work in progress and will continue to grow as I work through more challenges and concepts.
