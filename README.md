# JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Solutions
Welcome! This repository contains my solutions and notes for learning and practicing core computer science concepts — especially algorithms and data structures — using JavaScript.
## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in problem solving, algorithm design, and data structure implementation through structured challenges and exercises.

## 🛠️ What's Included
- Problem-solving patterns (e.g., frequency counter, multiple pointers, sliding window)
- Recursion techniques (helper method recursion, pure recursion)
- Classic algorithms (binary search, quick sort, merge sort, etc.)
- Data structures (singly linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Time and space complexity analysis with Big O notation
- Clean, testable, and well-commented JavaScript solutions

## Structure
### Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed. It is commonly used in programming for tasks such as managing function calls and undo mechanisms in applications.


## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```bash

```

## 🧭 Progress

This repo is a work in progress and will continue to grow as I work through more challenges and concepts.
